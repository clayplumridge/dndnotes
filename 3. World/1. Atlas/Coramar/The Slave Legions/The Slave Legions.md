# The Slave Legions of Coramar
The Slave Legions are bands of elite warriors trained by the Holy Empire of Coramar to be perfect soldiers. They are, as the name suggests, enslaved by the Empire, and are put through grueling and torturous training to break their members physically and mentally.

Most members of the Legions are so fundamentally loyal to the Empire as a result of their training that organized rebellion is nearly impossible, as any loyalist would immediately bring the wrath of the entire Kingdom down upon the Legion.

The Legions are 400 men strong (including officers) and are organized into the following hierarchy:
- Legion (400)
	- 4 Centuria (100)
		- 5 Cohorts (20 men)

## Suicide Missions
The Legions are deployed only when the odds are stacked against the Empire and failure would be disastrous. They are incredibly costly to raise and are treated as strategic assets of the utmost importance. However, they are generally considered to be deployable only once, as the circumstances of their deployment usually results in the deaths of almost every member.

No legion is publicly known to have survived a deployment. However, [[The Fourth Legion]] was deployed in circumstances less dire than the Empire estimated, and as a result 57 men survived. Having seen through the brainwashing of the Empire, these men fled the battlefield and have been in hiding.

## Beliefs

### The Call

### The Glory
The Glory is the moment where The Call is accomplished, when the Legion has fulfilled its purpose and have siezed victory for the Empire in circumstances otherwise impossible.

### The Fall
The Fall is the inevitable fate of the Legion, cut down after achieving The Glory
