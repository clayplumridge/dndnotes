### Song of the Legions
Hear my, plea to the fallen
Leave me, to be with the broken
One last, time before I go

Hold the, last burning ember
Let us, never surrender
May we, rise unto the Call
For the Glory and the Fall

For the beat and the broken 
For the lost and forsaken
Let us never surrender
May we rise unto the Call

For the beat and the broken
For the lost and forsaken
Let us never surrender
For the Glory and the Fall

For the beat and the broken
For the lost and forsaken
Let us never surrender
Now we rise unto the Call

Chains that, we are breaking
Fate that, we are awaiting
We will rise unto the Call
