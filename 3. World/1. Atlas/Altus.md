## GM Summary
Altus is a capitalist hellscape born of the hubris of a billionaire that appropriates the traditions of the people it displaced during its creation without context and simultaneously supports the military-industrial complex of every warmongering nation on the planet. It's the gilded age writ to the absurd.

## Overview and Geography
Altus is a small city-state, home to the [[#Academy Arcane]], and is a minor port on the western coast of Cadia. Altus sits on the only flat piece of land for miles up and down the coast, bordered on all sides by the [[Stormridge Mountains]] and only accessible by sea or teleportation.

## Culture
Due to the central influence of the [[#Academy Arcane]] on the economics and history of Altus, the city views [[Arcane Magic]] very favorably and looks down on [[Divine Magic]] and [[Druidic Magic]].

### Garden Parties!
Wealthy Arcane-gifted women make a hobby of curating plants using magic. Their plants are universally for show, and exhibit incredible sensory features including smell, taste, touch, and sight. They never curate plants that produce food, considering those species to be "base" and "inelegant".

Druidic magic, by contrast, could perform every one of these "feats" without much effort.

## Economy
Altus imports nearly everything it needs to function, owing to the incredibly wealthy residents and significant grants from the nations of the world. In exchange for these grants, they produce War Mages for the rest of the world (see [[#History]]).

## History
Altus is the child of the excessive hubris of its incredibly wealthy founder, $FOUNDER. He paid an exorbitant amount of money to several archmages to found the [[#Academy Arcane]] in the Altus Valley without enough consideration for basic infrastructure, like food. As a result, the Academy needs to import almost all food that it needs to survive.

The cost to teleport food, in addition to the limited throughput of teleportation, meant that docks needed to be constructed. The docks necessitated the construction of a temple to Iono for the sailors, and slowly but surely a city sprung up around the Academy. However, the dwindling fortune of $FOUNDER became a problem.

Altus rapidly needed a way to fund itself, and began seeking grants from the nations of the world. Citing the high departure rate of the Academy itself, the nations of the world asked the Academy to begin training War Mages from the "less-capable" students to give them a career path. The Academy did, and the operations of the city have been funded almost exclusively by these "donations" ever since. The occupants of the city, however, are independently wealthy.

The founding of Altus displaced a moderately-large commune of "primitive" Druids, who now live in secret in the surrounding [[Stormridge Mountains]].
