Aesthetic: Nokron, the Eternal City

The Crystal City is the only major city in The Underdark and is uniquely home to both Drow and Dwarves. It began construction nearly 500 years ago before the wedding of King Dorammorlim Ironhand and Queen Rhizanthella Maevaal.

## The Royal Family
### King Dorammorlim Ironhand (The Skyminer)
Note: Despite being agender, Dwarves refer to their leaders as King.

### Queen Rhizanthella Maevaal
Queen Maevaal was told stories of the night sky as a child and became fascinated by it, and has made it a lifelong goal to one day visit the surface to witness it herself.

### The Royal Fuckboy
Big bisexual best friend energy. Make him a druid? Mycologist? Hedonist? Has this dude been riding high on molly for a hundred years?
As Dwarves are agender, Queen Maevaal keeps a consort and has since she was Queen of the Drow, and considers her consort to be a dear friend. When first courting King Ironhand, Queen Maevaal nervously explained the existence of her consort, only to be met with enthusiastic consent from the King, who recognizes that she has needs that they cannot fulfill. The Skyminer immediately put forward that the Royal Consort should become a member of their eventual family.

### Children
The King and Queen have both Dwarf and Drow children. However, the Dwarf children are only descendants of the King, and the Drow children are descendants of Queen Maevaal and The Royal Fuckboy. The royals consider them all their direct children, and do not consider The Royal Fuckboy to be their parents.

## The Crystal Sky
As a wedding gift to Queen Maevaal, King Ironhand had the ceiling of the Great Cavern fitted with a dazzling number of crystals that were infused to sparkle and emit light. As a result, The Crystal City has, underground, a sky of twinkling stars.

## The Great Elevator
After the founding of the Crystal City, King Ironhand ordered the construction of a Great Elevator to connect the city to the surface. Located shortly outside the Great Cavern, The Great Elevator took 127 years to complete, and was completed only 5 years ago. As a result, The Crystal City is still grappling with the trade and cultural implications of being connected to the surface world.

The Great Elevator can only move a few dozen people at a time, and is therefore unsuitable for large shipments. Travelling up and down can take upwards of 8 hours, making it also impractical as a logistical system.

In building The Great Elevator, the Dwarves dug for years at a time. When they first reached the surface and "broke ground", some of the mining crew were stricken with crippling agoraphobia. When they were brough back home, some sought treatment, but none ever ventured back to the surface. Many of those that did not seek treatment consider the surface to be a profane, unwelcoming place that it should be forbidden for Dwarves and Drow alike to tread on.

Between the completion of the tunnel itself and The Great Elevator entire, enough dissidents became enthralled with the idea that the Surface was a profane place and should be forbidden. As a result, Queen Maevaal has been politically unable to visit the surface and see the stars.
