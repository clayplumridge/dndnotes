Preva is the god of courtship and love, whose priests are often sought out by lovers when their path forward is unclear.

## Priesthood
Priests of Preva dress in red and pink robes adorned with gold. Training as a priest involves a great deal of instruction on both the physical and emotional aspects of love, and lovers might seek out a priest to act as a relationship counselor.
