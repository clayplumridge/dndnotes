Aza Guilla is the goddess of death. She embraces, cares for, and weighs the souls of the dead. Her followers court death, seeking to understand it, and see death as a gift instead of a curse. She is among the most honored and respected of The Twelve.

Aza Guilla is often depicted wearing a veil.

## Priesthood
Priests of Aza Guilla wear plain black robes with no adornement, and conceal their faces behind the Sorrowful Visage. Senior priests and priestesses wear braided silver collars to signify their rank.

The Sorrowful Visage is a mask composed of a featureless hemisphere of fine silver mesh, designed to be intentionally disconcerting.

Training to become a priest of Aza Guilla is a long, laborious process shrouded in secrecy. None but the priesthood know the true nature of their training, which involves seemingly courting death at every turn. Initiates are exsanguinated, poisoned, hung by the neck until unconsciousness, and often sleep in tombs. Dangerous walkways in their training centers are forbidden to have handrails, and construction is encouraged to make maneuvering as risky as possible.

## Relationships
### Priesthood
Nobody is listening to her, and everything would be better if they did for like 2 seconds. When her priesthood first sprang up, they started seeking ways to become close to her to learn the "inner mysteries" of death. When told that they should NOT be doing that, they misinterpreted the message repeatedly as an affirmation that death brings them closer, and misinterpreting her words to inspire a perverse relationship with death and life.

### [[Dama Elliza]] 
Either sisters or lovers. More likely sisters. Both fight with a scythe.
