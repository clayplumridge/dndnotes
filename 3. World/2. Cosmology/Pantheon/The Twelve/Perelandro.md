Perelandro is the god of mercy, protector of the week and helpless. He is the god of orphans and beggars, and is often the butt of jokes among those less pious.

## Priesthood
Priests of Perelandro wear simple hooded robes of plain white cotton with silver embroidery along the sleeves. They are expected to live austere lives with minimal comforts or luxuries, giving the money their church collects instead to the poor and overlooked.
