Galadaya inherited control of the Life domain from [[Nara]] during the [[Third Age of Strife]] after her death at the hands of [[Nurgle]]. After she found herself in the Astral Plane after inheriting the power, [[Aza Guilla]] trained her in the mechanics of godhood including [[Investiture]] and [[Dominion]].

Some time after inheriting the Life domain, Gala became the first of [[The Twelve]] to birth a new domain in Protection, though she couldn't tell you how she did it. The rest of [[The Twelve]] are similarly baffled.

In reality, Gala split the Life domain in two; [[Nara]]'s conception of Life as "things must stay breathing and hearts beating" became the "new" Protection domain, and the Life domain became more aligned with Gala's conception of it as joy and experience.

## Life Before Ascension
Gala spent a significant portion of her youth in the [[Feywild]], stumbling in through unknown means as a child.

## Fey Influence on Ascension
The residents of the [[Feywild]] took action after the death of [[Nara]] to ensure that Gala was the one who inherited her abandoned domain.
