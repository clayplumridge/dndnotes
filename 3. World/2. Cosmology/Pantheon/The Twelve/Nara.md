Nara was killed by [[Nurgle]] during the [[Third Age of Strife]] after warring with him for control of the Plague domain. In one of the final battles of the age, Nara sacrificed herself to give humanity a chance to win the war, and leverages her death to sever her two domains from eachother. While her defeat forefit the Plague domain to Nurgle, this would allow for [[Galadaya]] to pick up the Life domain and join [[The Twelve]].
