Gandolo is the god of business and commerce, and is thus the gods to which merchants make their primary oath.

Gandolo is depicted as round-bellied, fat, sly, and infinitely content.

Option: Gandolo in the flesh is shredded, and is basically just rise-and-grind sigma-grindset culture.


## Priesthood
Initiates of the priesthood get pastries and ale every second week, and a copper piece every Sunday to spend as they wish in honor of Gandolo.
