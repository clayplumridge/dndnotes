Morgante is the god of order, hierarchies, and harsh consequences. Morgante is often worshipped by executioners, constables, and judges.

Morgante does not care if laws are just, only that they are enforced.

Morgante is infinitely well-studied in the laws, bylaws, codes, and strictures of every conceivable level of government, and understands how to achieve virtually any legislative goal. However, he has no opinion on what those goals should be, but does offer advice to mortals if they request it. They usually don't, because nobody thinks that God spent any time reading thousands of pages of regulations.

## Priesthood
Priests of Morgante wear black and grey robes, with mantles bearing emblems of crossed hammers and trowels.
