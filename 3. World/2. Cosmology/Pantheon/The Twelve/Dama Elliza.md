Dama Elliza is the god of agriculture, worshipped by farmers.

Dama Elliza is more than the goddess of rain and the harvest. She knows that food is a universal experience, and considers it incredibly important, in part because it is home and hearth. As a result, her priesthood has an incredibly straightforward canon that is almost exactly as she would write it across the entire world.

## Priesthood
Priests of Dama Elliza wear brown and green robes trimmed with silver. As part of their training, they are sent to farming communities to work the land.
