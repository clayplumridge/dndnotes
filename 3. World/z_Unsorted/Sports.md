# Snowboarding (TODO: Name)
Mostly practiced by Druids, it's regular snowboarding, except for the Druid parts. Druids will manifest snowbanks to ride on while heading down the mountain.

It's sometimes practiced by others, but most don't really want to do it if they can't make the banks themselves. Those that do are usually welcomed by the Druids though, who are stoked to see others enjoying themselves. Those that are good at it will be invited to ride in a pack of Druids, who will make the banks for them.
