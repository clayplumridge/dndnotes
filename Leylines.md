The Leylines were crafted by [[The Twelve#Sendovani - Dead]] long before her death to create a mechanism for the Mortal Races to wield [[Arcane Magic]], Investing a significant portion of her power to do so. Originally, the Leylines slowly moved around the world, and places where they crossed were sites of exceptional power.

When [[Theofania]] killed Sendovani, he inherited her dominion over Arcane Magic, and managed to gain a degree of control over her Investiture around the Leylines. During the [[First Age of Strife]], Tzeentch weakened and strengthened the Leylines to weaken his enemies and empower his armies. When it became clear that Tzeentch would lose his first attempt at conquest, he froze the Leylines in place, knowing that the Mortal Races would build cities at the places where they intersected, granting him an avenue into the seats of power for all time.

During the [[Second Age of Strife]] and [[Third Age of Strife]], [[Theofania]] repeated his strategy of weakening the Leylines for his enemies and strengthening them for his forces.
