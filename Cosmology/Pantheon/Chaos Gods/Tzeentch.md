# Tzeentch
**Titles** - Changer of Ways, Great Deceiver
**Symbols** -
**The Vibe** -
**Domains** - Deceit, The Arcane

Tzeentch was the first of the [[Chaos Gods]] to emerge from the collective unconscious of the mortal races. He was born during the [[First Age of Strife]] and later caused the [[Third Age of Strife]] by breaking [[Khorne]] out of the $TODO and using his cunning to birth [[Nurgle]].

Tzeentch was originally the god of Deceit, but during the [[First Age of Strife]] he killed [[Sendovani]] and stole control over the domain of The Arcane.

Tzeentch has a modicum of control over [[Leylines]], and is responsible for freezing them in place.

## Fatal Flaw
Tzeentch's fatal flaw is that plots too far, and has plans-within-plans-within-plans into the infinite. He will never achieve his ultimate goals because then his plans would end.
