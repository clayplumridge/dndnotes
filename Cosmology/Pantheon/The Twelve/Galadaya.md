## Galadaya
**Title** - Guardian of Blood and Spirit
**Symbols** - Eglantyne Rose with a red ribbon tied around it
**The Vibe** - Bro it's Gala
**Domains** - Life, Protection

Galadaya inherited control of the Life domain from Nara during the [[Third Age of Strife]] after her death at the hands of [[Nurgle]]. After she found herself in the Astral Plane after inheriting the power, [[Aza Guilla]] trained her in the mechanics of godhood including [[Investiture]] and [[Dominion]].

Some time after inheriting the Life domain, Gala became the first of [[The Twelve]] to birth a new domain in Protection, though she couldn't tell you how she did it. The rest of [[The Twelve]] are similarly baffled.
