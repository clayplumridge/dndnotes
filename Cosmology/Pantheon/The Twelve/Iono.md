## Iono

Iono is the god of the sea and is primarily worshipped by sailors. He is called upon for protection for any ship voyage, and is known to love mortal women. As such, most sailors will refuse to leave harbor without a woman aboard the ship. As a result, a disproportionate (especially historically) number of women are captains and mates on ships.

### Priesthood
Priests of Iono typically wear sea-green robes fringed in silver. Captains can be declared a [[Lay Priest]] of Iono with minimal worship at a proper temple, allowing them to lead prayer, perform marriage, and give death rites while at sea.
