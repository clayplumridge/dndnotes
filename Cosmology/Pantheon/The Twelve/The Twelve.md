The Twelve are the pantheon of the [[Therinism]], and the source of all [[Divine Magic]] in $TODO.

The Twelve reside primarily in the Astral Plane in separate domains. These act as their home and a locus of their power, making them nigh-unkillable while there. However, their direct influence over the mortal world is limited while there, and they can only act by communicating with mortals that stray close to their conceptual domains. As an example, Aza Guilla can communicate with mortals only when they stray near death. Individuals that stray particularly close may come away with a blessing from the God in the form of divine power; eg. Clerics.

The Twelve can freely move into the Material Plane, but become greatly weakened and are vulnerable. They can be much more easily killed while there.

The Twelve were originally The Thirteen, but [[Sendovani]] and [[Nara]] were slain during the [[First Age of Strife]] and [[Third Age of Strife]] respectively.

The Twelve are aware of the existence of the [[Chaos Gods]] and undertake measures to keep their influence contained.
