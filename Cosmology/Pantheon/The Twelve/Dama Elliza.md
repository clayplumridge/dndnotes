## Dama Elliza
**Titles** - Mother of Rains and Reaping

Dama Elliza is the god of agriculture, worshipped by farmers.

Dama Elliza is more than the goddess of rain and the harvest. She knows that food is a universal experience, and considers it incredibly important, in part because it is home and hearth. As a result, her priesthood has an incredibly straightforward canon that is almost exactly as she would write it across the entire world.

### Priesthood
Priests of Dama Elliza wear brown and green robes trimmed with silver. As part of their training, they are sent to farming communities to work the land.
