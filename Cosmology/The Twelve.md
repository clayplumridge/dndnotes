The Twelve are the pantheon of the [[Therinism]], and the source of all [[Divine Magic]] in $TODO.

The Twelve reside primarily in the Astral Plane in separate domains. These act as their home and a locus of their power, making them nigh-unkillable while there. However, their direct influence over the mortal world is limited while there, and they can only act by communicating with mortals that stray close to their conceptual domains. As an example, Aza Guilla can communicate with mortals only when they stray near death. Individuals that stray particularly close may come away with a blessing from the God in the form of divine power; eg. Clerics.

The Twelve can freely move into the Material Plane, but become greatly weakened and are vulnerable. They can be much more easily killed while there.

## Iono
**Titles** - Lord of the Grasping Waters, Stormbringer

Iono is the god of the sea and is primarily worshipped by sailors. He is called upon for protection for any ship voyage, and is known to love mortal women. As such, most sailors will refuse to leave harbor without a woman aboard the ship. As a result, a disproportionate (especially historically) number of women are captains and mates on ships.

### Priesthood
Priests of Iono typically wear sea-green robes fringed in silver. Captains can be declared a [[Lay Priest]] of Iono with minimal worship at a proper temple, allowing them to lead prayer, perform marriage, and give death rites while at sea.

## Aza Guilla
**Titles** - The Lady of the Long Silence, The Lady Most Kind
**The Vibe** - Black woman that nobody is listening to and they really should.

Aza Guilla is the goddess of death. She embraces, cares for, and weighs the souls of the dead. Her followers court death, seeking to understand it, and see death as a gift instead of a curse. She is among the most honored and respected of The Twelve

Aza Guilla is often depicted wearing a veil.

### Priesthood
Priests of Aza Guilla wear plain black robes with no adornement, and conceal their faces behind the Sorrowful Visage. Senior priests and priestesses wear braided silver collars to signify their rank.

The Sorrowful Visage is a mask composed of a featureless hemisphere of fine silver mesh, designed to be intentionally disconcerting.

Training to become a priest of Aza Guilla is a long, laborious process shrouded in secrecy. None but the priesthood know the true nature of their training, which involves seemingly courting death at every turn. Initiates are exsanguinated, poisoned, hung by the neck until unconsciousness, and often sleep in tombs. Dangerous walkways in their training centers are forbidden to have handrails, and construction is encouraged to make maneuvering as risky as possible.

### Relationship to Priesthood
Nobody is listening to her, and everything would be better if they did for like 2 seconds. When her priesthood first sprang up, they started seeking ways to become close to her to learn the "inner mysteries" of death. When told that they should NOT be doing that, they misinterpreted the message repeatedly as an affirmation that death brings them closer, and misinterpreting her words to inspire a perverse relationship with death and life.

### Relationship to Dama Elliza
Either sisters or lovers. More likely sisters. Both fight with a scythe.

## Perelandro
**Titles** - Lord of the Overlooked, Father of Mercies, The Beggar God (derisive)

Morgante is infinitely well-studied in the laws, bylaws, codes, and strictures of every conceivable level of government, and understands how to achieve virtually any legislative goal. However, he has no opinion on what those goals should be, but does offer advice to mortals if they request it. They usually don't, because nobody thinks that God spent any time reading thousands of pages of regulations.

### Priesthood
Priests of Morgante wear black and grey robes, with mantles bearing emblems of crossed hammers and trowels.

**Symbols** - Scythe
**The Vibe** - Black mom's house

Dama Elliza is the god of agriculture, worshipped by farmers.

Dama Elliza is more than the goddess of rain and the harvest. She knows that food is a universal experience, and considers it incredibly important, in part because it is home and hearth.
